# :sunrise: IBM Digital Tech Tutorial: Watson Visual Recognition
In this hands-on tutorial you will use IBM Watson Visual Recognition Service and build a virtual art expert that identifies the artist of a painting. It shows you how to create and train your custom image classifiers using your own image collections.

## Prerequisites
1. Sign up for an [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration).
2. Fill in the required information and press the â€žCreate Account" button.
3. After you submit your registration, you will receive an e-mail from the IBM Cloud team with details about your account. In this e-mail, you will need to click the link provided to confirm your registration.
4. Now you should be able to login to your new IBM Cloud account
